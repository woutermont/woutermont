👋 Hi, I’m [@woutermont](https://github.com/woutermont), Linked Data Engineer and Semantic Web Philosopher, working as Senior Researcher on the development of [Solid](https://solidproject.org) technology at [imec](https://imec-int.com), and contributing to different projects and specifications within and around the realm of Solid, RDF and Linked Data in general. In the past I've worked around graph-based data storage and inference within digital humanities, as well as on several philosophical topics, including logic, philosophy of biology, idealistic metaphysics, and ethics of artificial intelligence.
